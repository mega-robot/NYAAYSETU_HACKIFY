# ⚖️ NYAAYSETU – The Gig Worker Justice Bridge

> *Justice for the Invisible Workforce - Because no one should lose their livelihood to an algorithm they cannot question.*

---

## 🌍 The Reality We Chose to Confront

India has **15+ million gig workers** — delivery partners, drivers, service professionals — who keep our cities running every single day.

Yet their lives are controlled by **opaque platforms** that can:

* Deactivate accounts **without warning**
* Withhold or miscalculate payouts
* Impose unfair penalties
* Manipulate ratings
* Offer *no real grievance redressal*

For most gig workers, **one suspension means zero income**.
No explanation. No appeal. No human support.

👉 **NYAAYSETU exists to change this.**

## 💡 Our Vision

**NYAAYSETU** ("Bridge to Justice") is a transparency-first digital grievance redressal and audit platform for gig workers.

We are not just building software —
we are **giving workers visibility, voice, and verifiable proof**.

This platform acts as:

* A **safe space** for workers to raise issues
* A **truth layer** between workers and platforms
* A **data-backed accountability system**
